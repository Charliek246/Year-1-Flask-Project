# Year-1-Flask-Project
A repo created to store a project from year 1 of university (2021/2022)

This project was an excersie in demonsotrating knowledge of flask, python and basic json manipulation. The goal was to create a website that would run locally to store and output 'quotes' that the user would input and then view on the site. Whilst initally written on the platform: **replt.it** this repository was made to store this as repl is no longer a website that is regularly used by me.

### Frameworks/technologies used:
  * Python
  * HMTL
  * CSS
  * Flask
  * JSON
